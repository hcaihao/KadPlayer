/*
Please do not change anything here and release it..
There is going to be a new forum created just for the Kademlia side of the client..
If you feel there is an error or a way to improve something, please
post it in the forum first and let us look at it.. If it is a real improvement,
it will be added to the offical client.. Changing something without knowing
what all it does can cause great harm to the network if released in mass form..
Any mod that changes anything within the Kademlia side will not be allowed to advertise
there client on the eMule forum..
